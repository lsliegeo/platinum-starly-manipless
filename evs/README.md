# EV and exp route

We always want to assume the minimal level and evs for the damage calcs.
This way you will never take more damage than shown in a defensive damage table.
You also will never have lower odds for a range than shown in an offensive damage table.

For safety, we also assume split exp on the Nosepass (before Hearthome), Bronzor (Calvin) and Shieldon (Calvin).

## Fist Plate skip
Doing the fist plate skip, and thus fighting the Heracross optional gives less exp and less (attack) evs than fighting the 3 Machops from the black belt guarding the fist plate.
So in order to guarantee minimal exp and evs, the route will always assume fist plate skip.

## Ruin Maniac Calvin
Your level before the Calvin fight isn't always the same.
* Did you split exp on the nosepass?
* Did you fight the Heracross optional?
* Should we postpone the exp from the Heracross fight until after Calvin?
* And did that result in one more or less level ups?

You should always be lvl 27 before Calvin UNLESS you shared exp on the Nosepass and you did not fight the Heracross optional, in which case you would be lvl 26.
If you caught a lvl 11 Starly you would level up to 27 after the Bronzor.
With a lvl 9 or 10 Starly you would level up to 27 after the Shieldon.

## Rare candies in Veilstone gym
Candy from 30 to 34.

After the mandatory gym trainer with Croagunk and Machoke you should reach lvl 30, allowing you to candy to lvl 34 for evolution.
You should always reach lvl 34 at that point UNLESS you shared exp on the Nosepass, Bronzor and Shieldon, and you're doing fist plate skip, in which case you should fight the optional with Heracross.

## Rare candy in Canalave gym
Candy from 43 to 44.

After fighting the first Steelix you should always reach lvl 43.

## Rare candy on snow route
Candy from 48 to 50.

You should always be lvl 48 after defeating the trainer with Kirlia, Buneary and Seaking.
In the rare case where you did not split exp during the galactic double battle before Mars 2 (full exp from a single pokemon is enough), you should reach lvl 48 before fighting the snow route trainer, allowing you to candy early.
